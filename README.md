# THE DOGHOUSE — ATHHS Sales Presentation & Training App

The all-product sales asset for Around The House Home Solutions reps: customer-facing
presentations plus rep-only "Training Coach" resources, per product. Sunesta® Awnings
is fully built (22-slide deck + Sunesta Coach); Eclipse® Screens, Gutter Helmet®, and
Louvered Pergolas are registered shells waiting for content (`PRODUCTS` in `js/data.js`,
flip `ready:true` when a product ships).

**Live:** https://aroundthehouseco.github.io/the-dog-house/ — GitHub Pages, repo
`AroundTheHouseCo/the-dog-house`, served from `main` `/` (root). Pushing to `main`
redeploys (~30–60s). Installed on iPads via Add to Home Screen (PWA: standalone,
branded icon). Plain HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no dependencies.

## Architecture

```
index.html           — shell + PWA meta; loads css/js in order
css/styles.css       — all styling, one file
js/images-map.js     — semantic image keys → files in /images (swap photos here)
js/data.js           — ALL content: DECK (slides), TRAINING_REFERENCE, PRODUCTS registry
js/library-data.js   — GENERATED photo library + docs manifest (asset pipeline output)
js/app.js            — render engine + view routing (touch only for new slide TYPES)
images/              — slide assets, photo library, frame sequences, icons
docs/                — spec-sheet + fabric PDFs (Training Center → Docs)
```

**The split is the contract:** content edits live in `data.js`/`images-map.js` and never
require touching `app.js`. Slide numbers (`#N — Title`) are computed from slide order —
never hardcode them anywhere (they drift on every insert/delete).

**View state machine** (`appView` in app.js): `home` → `present-picker`/`center-picker`
(per-product) → `present` (customer-facing deck) or `center` (Training Coach hub:
deck-with-notes, 10-Step Process, Pre-Demo Recap, Do & Don't, FAQs, Pricing & Close,
Photo Library, Docs). **Customer mode must never show training UI** — no "training",
"coach", "script", or "rep-only" text may be visible; verify with a DOM text sweep, not
by eyeballing. Training Mode reads `script`/`talkingPoints`/`coach`/`personalTouch`
straight from each slide's data, so slide edits update both modes automatically.

**Slide types** (all data-driven): videoloop (YouTube segment loop), splittext/splitphoto
(optional `cert`, `scrub` mini-video-scrubber, `docViewer` in-app document book),
herosplit, photogrid, credibility, difference, triangle, reasonsphoto (pill hotspots w/
popup photos), reasonsgrid (`columns:1` variant), productcards (photo cards; `num` chips,
`popPhoto` popovers, `eyebrow`, auto-`dense` grid when >3 rows), models (spec popups +
3-model compare + competitor chart), videoscrub (frame-sequence scrubber), processsteps
(icon timeline), warrantyrecap (tiles + interactive triangle + service strip).
**New-type bar:** only add a type when every existing one demonstrably fails.

## The z-index / stacking-context trap (has bitten repeatedly)

Invisible tap-to-advance nav zones sit at **z-index 5** over most slides. Any
`clip-path`, `transform`, `opacity<1`, or `filter` on a *container* of clickable
children creates a stacking context that silently traps them below the nav zones.

Layer map: nav zones **5** · interactive children (pills, cards, tri-nodes) **6–10** ·
popovers **20** · modals/fullscreen popups **30** · slide-number badge **50** ·
in-app doc viewer **60** (covers the badge deliberately).

Rules: interactive *containers* stay free of those four properties; interactive
*children* get explicit z-index ≥6; `photogrid` and `models` have **no nav zones by
design** (arrows/dots only). Fullscreen headers need top padding (~46px) or the #N
badge overlaps them.

## Verification standard (every change)

1. `node --check` all touched JS.
2. Walk **all** slides in both customer and training modes: every slide has its badge,
   no `img` with missing/`undefined` src, zero console errors/warnings.
3. Hit-test every touched interactive slide with `document.elementFromPoint()` at real
   coordinates — programmatic `.click()` bypasses the stacking bug you're checking for.
   Confirm: element receives the tap AND empty space still advances.
4. Screenshot anything structurally new for review before it ships.
5. After push: poll the live URL until the change lands, `diff` live files vs committed
   (`git show HEAD:path` vs `curl`), and spot-check new assets return 200 with correct
   MIME types. Pages caches ~10 min — hard-refresh the iPad after deploys.

## Design language

- Palette via CSS vars: `--green-dark #1b5e3f`, `--green #2e7d4f`, `--orange #F5A623`,
  charcoal/cream/bg (see `:root`). Em-dash-heavy, plain-spoken copy.
- **Native SVG over screenshots** — never bake text into raster images. Icon style:
  200×200 viewBox, `#eef6ee` rounded-18 background, green/orange strokes.
- Recurring motifs: green chevron divider, ATH footer banner, pill hotspots, warranty
  tiles (`.wt`), numbered chips. GitHub Pages is **case-sensitive** and serves from a
  subpath — asset paths stay lowercase and **relative** (never leading-slash).

## Content rules (binding — see the script doc + project memory for rulings)

- Source of truth for Sunesta copy: `Sunesta Awning Master Script — FINAL DRAFT
  2026-07-14.md` (Rev 2, Desktop) — use its language verbatim, don't paraphrase.
- Warranty per the 2026 doc: frame lifetime · arms Sunesta lifetime / Sunstyle 15yr /
  Sunlight 12yr · fabric 10yr · motor 10yr · electronics 5yr. Wind sensor is **standard**
  on motorized units, never an add-on.
- Unverified claims (NC/FL manufacturing, 80k cycles, wind-sensor mechanism) stay OUT of
  customer-facing copy — training scripts only, prefixed `⚠️ UNVERIFIED`.
- Rep-facing pricing (drop-screen motor ~$1k, LED return-trip, rebuttal scripts) lives in
  `script`/`coach` fields only, never in bullets/labels customers see.
- CC-licensed photos require credits (kept as comments in `js/data.js`).

## Known gaps / backlog

- Reference Map slide ships a labeled placeholder — real map asset pending.
- Pending from Matt: crossarms explainer, drop-screen selling points, high-end price
  rebuttal ending, competitor estimate photos. Money Fork / Thermometer Close: blocked
  until Jack supplies the Profectus material.
- DoY/Our People slide is a marked first draft. Awaiting real crew photo, lit-awning
  night shot, myLink app screenshots.
- Eclipse / Gutter Helmet / Pergola decks + coaches: shells only.
- Someday: in-app Edit Mode; offline wrap (Capacitor or service worker).
